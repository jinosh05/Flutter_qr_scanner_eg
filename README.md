I kept the code as original as possible with proper Commented Guides for anyone to understand and implement. Still you need to follow these steps.

  - Now download this [Repo](https://github.com/jinosh05/Flutter_qr_scanner_eg/zip/master)
  - Extract the Repo into your newly created **qr_scanner_eg** and replace the required files.
  - Now you can Finally run VS-Code or Android Studio whichever you prefer and get the flutter packages and just run the App.
